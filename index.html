I'VE BEEN LEARNING TO CODE. <br>
IT'S A MASSIVE PAIN IN THE ARSE. <br><br>
I'VE MADE STUFF WITH CODE BEFORE, <br>BUT IT'S USUALLY BEEN SOMEONSE ELSE'S THAT I'VE TWEAKED, <br>AND NOT REALLY UNDERSTOOD WHY OR HOW IT WORKED.<br>AND THAT CAN BE QUITE CONFUSING. <br><br>SO I DECIDED I WANTED TO START MAKING SOME INTERACTIVE THINGS FOR THE WEB SO I COULD LEARN HOW IT ALL WORKS. <br>SO THAT I CAN CREATE INTERESTING AND INTERACTIVE MUSIC EXPERIENCES WITH A NEW TOOL. <br><br>THAT'S KIND OF HOW I'M LOOKING AT THIS WHOLE EXPERIENCE. <br>BASICALLY LEARNING HOW TO PLAY A NEW INSTRUMENT. <br>HOW TO HOLD IT, WHAT IT'S MADE OF, WHAT SOUNDS IT CAN MAKE AND HOW TO MAKE THEM. <br><br>ABOVE ARE SOME EXAMPLES OF SOME THINGS I'VE MADE OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS. I'M AWARE THEY ARE FAIRLY BASIC. <br>THEY'RE PROBABLY THE EQUIVALENT OF LEARNING HOW TO PLAY A D7 AND THE INTRO TO SWEET CHILD OF MINE. <br>BUT I'VE STUCK A ROUTINE AND IT'S WORKING. <br><br>I AM MAKING STUFF WITH CODE. <br><br>I AM VERBING.
